\begin{quote}
A* and variants are regularly applied to plan paths in a graph. Rather than planning each query from scratch, we follow the recent trend across AI and robotics of collecting and reusing information, i.e. learning. Experience-graphs (E-graphs) store past plans in order to speed up related planning episodes in the future. New challenges arise when we try to apply E-graphs in high-level planning, where the state graph is implicitly exponentially sized in its description length. We describe an algorithm that combines E-graphs with a standard STRIPS relaxation to form $\epsilon$-admissible heuristics in a domain-independent manner.
